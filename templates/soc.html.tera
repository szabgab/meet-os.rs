      <h2 class="title is-4">Background</h2>

      A minimum requirement of every person participating on the web site and in events is to adher to the rule of law. We could emphasize a few of them here, but that would not add value.
      The Soc is to further define and limit(!) the accepted behaviour and speech.
       
      <h2 class="title is-4">Expected Behavior</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.</li>
        <li>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory or harassing behavior and speech.</li>
        <li>Be mindful of your fellow participants.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="title is-4">Unacceptable Behavior</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory, or demeaning conduct by any participant.</li>
        <li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, religion, country of origin, country of residence, or disability (including presentation slides).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="title is-4">Updates</h2>
